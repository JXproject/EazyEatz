#EazyEatz

#Idea
Restaurants today are stuck in the past and EazyEatz aims to change that. When you go out for dinner, EazyEatz—utilizing beacon technology—identifies the specific table and restaurant that you and your friends are eating at. While dining, EazyEats allows you to review the menu, order food, and the best part is that when you're done you can just get up and leave. EazyEatz automatically splits your party's bill (equally, or sliced up however you like!), and our innovative leave-and-pay technology reduces the hassle of paying by allowing you to simply leave the restaurant and automatically have your bill charged to you. 

#Challenges
There were a few different challenges in the making of this project, mainly: 
* Git smashing all application files half way through the event
* Estimote Beacons being locked to their registered owners (of whom we are not) 
* A significant portion of the technologies utilized were new to the team
